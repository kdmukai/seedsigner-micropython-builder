# TODO — remaining ESP32 firmware work for the SeedSigner LVGL cutover

**Created 2026-07-17.** Working-tree note. The screen/toast/scan/qr-display/address-verification
bindings (incl. `camera_entropy` + `set_labels`) are all present on `main` and firmware-validated;
submodule `deps/seedsigner-lvgl-screens @ 92be1e0` is current (no drift). This is the standing
"next priority" note for finishing the LVGL cutover on ESP32: the builder-side items below
(BUILDER-1, BUILDER-2) plus the app-side integration roadmap (carried in §"App-side LVGL
integration roadmap" from the main `seedsigner` repo hub). None of it is on the current frozen
firmware.

## BUILDER-1 — full-display confirm-image in the entropy overlay

**Status:** ✅ implemented for the non-partition (DSI/image-widget) path — the **P4-43** — and
shipped in firmware (builder `d34da8a`); ⬜ the **P4-35** (partition-mode SPI) keeps the frozen
center square pending a compositing follow-up (see below). On-device **visual** verification of
the confirm image is still open (needs the touch-driven image-entropy flow).

`ports/esp32/camera_entropy/camera_entropy.cpp` now, on entering CONFIRM (`cam_entropy_get_result`
first-latch), runs `image_entropy_process()` on the latched **RAW** square frame → a full-panel
PSRAM RGB565 buffer → `camera_entropy_overlay_set_confirm_image()`, then flips the phase; the
overlay auto-hides it on `resume()`. Buffer is freed after the overlay deep-copies it; OOM
degrades to the frozen square. **Invariant preserved:** the crop+contrast is display-only —
`get_result()`'s `(chain, frame)` and the entropy chain stay the RAW latched bytes.

**Remaining (P4-35 / partition mode):** under `BOARD_CAMERA_PARTITION_MODE` the camera owns the
preview square as the sole SPI writer and LVGL's flush is redirected to the shadow-FB gutters, so
a full-display LVGL confirm image can't cover the square. The helper is compiled out there
(`#if !BOARD_CAMERA_PARTITION_MODE`). A partition-mode confirm image needs the processed frame
composited into the shadow FB (or the camera session ended / flush-redirect lifted) on entering
CONFIRM — a follow-up.

- Screens APIs used (already in the pinned submodule): `image_entropy_process()`,
  `camera_entropy_overlay_set_confirm_image()` (PR #73 `f948b1f`).
- **Byte-order note (verify on device):** the implementation assumes the latched frame is
  native-endian RGB565 (matching `image_entropy.h` + the desktop-verified path; the panel
  byte-swap, if any, happens uniformly at the display-driver flush below the LVGL layer). Confirm
  colors render correctly when the flow is exercised.

## BUILDER-2 — expose device-uniqueness + time for entropy composition (SEC-1)

Gated on the **SEC-1 sign-off** (see hub): if the native image-entropy hash must re-add the
device-serial + time contributions the PIL path folds in, the app's native branch needs
`machine.unique_id()` + `time.ticks_ms()` (standard esp32 port surface).

**✅ Verified present (2026-07-17).** The P4-43 firmware ELF exports `machine_unique_id` /
`mp_machine_unique_id` (`MP_QSTR_unique_id`, backed by `ESP_EFUSE_OPTIONAL_UNIQUE_ID`) and
`time.ticks_ms` / `ticks_us` / `ticks_diff`; `MICROPY_PY_MACHINE` is `1` in the esp32
`mpconfigport.h` and the network strip does not touch the `machine`/`time` modules. So no
firmware change is needed for BUILDER-2 — the primitives are already available to the app's
native `generate_mnemonic_from_camera_entropy` branch. This item stays open only as the
app-side contract: it unblocks once **SEC-1** decides whether to re-add the device-id + time
contributions (if SEC-1 accepts the drop, BUILDER-2 closes as a no-op).

## App-side LVGL integration roadmap (from the main `seedsigner` repo hub)

The remaining work to *fully* integrate the LVGL screens is mostly in the app repo, not the
firmware. It is coordinated by the hub
`seedsigner/docs/_integration/pil-hardwarebuttons-retirement-master-todo.md` (branch
`integration/lvgl-mpy`). Mirrored here so the builder repo carries the next-cycle plan; the hub
governs if they disagree. The `seedsigner` repo is **edit-restricted** — these land there via a
feature branch + the user's PR, not from this session.

**Two milestones (the app's, not the firmware's):** (1) retire the PIL-era `HardwareButtons`
GPIO reader once every input-blocking PIL screen on the Pi is native; (2) remove PIL entirely
(much further out — still coupled to the Pi camera source + display pipeline).

App-side items (milestone 1), several of which directly affect ESP32 behaviour:

| # | Task | Why it matters to ESP32 |
|---|---|---|
| APP-1 | `SeedTranscribeSeedQRConfirmScanView` → native scan (give it `ScanView`'s capability-gated / `IS_MICROPYTHON` split; `seed_views.py:1702`) | **Currently broken on ESP32** — the unconditional PIL `ScanScreen` path hits NotYetImplemented on device. Highest-value fix; no deps (both scan substrates exist in firmware). |
| APP-3 | Exception recovery → native `ErrorView` on CPython (`controller.py`) | Load-bearing for retirement; Pi-only, but keeps the native/PIL split coherent. |
| APP-4 | Exit blanking → native `clear_screen` (`controller.py:442`) | Pi-only. |
| APP-5 | Pi image-entropy native (`tools_views.py`) | Pairs with **BUILDER-1** — same native confirm-image path; gated on SEC-1. |
| APP-2 / APP-6..10 | addr-verify Pi flip, IO-test driver, toast `activation_delay` vestige, input-mode proxy, retire `HardwareButtons`, PIL display teardown | Pi-side cutover; no ESP32 firmware dependency beyond bindings already shipped. |

**SEC-1 (cross-cutting decision, needs an owner).** The native image-entropy path hashes only
`sha256(chain ‖ latched_frame)`; the PIL path additionally folded in the CPU serial + wall time.
The dominant camera-frame chain is preserved, but device-serial + time are dropped. Decide: re-add
device-id (`machine.unique_id()` on ESP32 / CPU serial on Pi) + a time source, or accept the drop.
This gates APP-5 and is the trigger for **BUILDER-1** (do the display-only confirm image) and the
already-satisfied **BUILDER-2** (primitives are exposed — see above).

**Suggested sequence (from the hub):** APP-1 → (RASPI-3 →) APP-2 → APP-3 + APP-4 →
(RASPI-1 + SEC-1 →) BUILDER-1 + APP-5 → APP-6 → APP-7 → APP-9 → APP-10.

## Not in scope (recorded)

- **io_test** — intentionally **not bound** for ESP32 (`docs/lvgl-screen-binding-gap-todo.md`:
  "io_test still skipped (Pi-only)"). No action unless a P4 I/O test is ever wanted (would need a
  bespoke `io_test_screen` + `io_test_set_capture_state` binding, and the screen forces
  `INPUT_MODE_HARDWARE` without restore — problematic on the touch panel).
- Submodule pin is current at `92be1e0`; no bump needed.

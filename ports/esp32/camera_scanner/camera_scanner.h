/*
 * camera_scanner — builder-owned MicroPython-facing glue for the QR scan pipeline.
 *
 * The thinnest composition that can ONLY live in the builder, where all three deps
 * already sit:
 *
 *   esp-camera-pipeline (engine)  --per-frame outcome-->  scan_coordinator
 *     (esp-board-common: transport-dedup + NEW ring + status cell + consecutive_misses)
 *       --neutral (percent, status)-->  THIS presenter  -->  camera_preview_overlay
 *         (seedsigner-lvgl-screens LVGL widgets, under the esp_lvgl_port lock)
 *
 * cam_scanner_start() OWNS the bring-up the coordinator deliberately does not: it
 * creates the camera pipeline (centered decode square), builds the overlay over the
 * active screen, and wires a coordinator whose injected present()/on_complete() drive
 * the overlay. The MicroPython consumer (eventually Python DecodeQR) then drains the
 * NEW ring + status cell on its own task and reports domain results back — see
 * docs/camera-pipeline-phase2-poll-contract.md.
 *
 * This header is binding-facing and SCALAR-ONLY by design: it pulls in NO engine,
 * LVGL, or k_quirc headers, so the MicroPython bindings' QSTR-scan include set (which
 * sees only this directory) stays clean — exactly the display_manager.h / dm_mem_stats
 * pattern. The scan_coordinator / pipeline / overlay headers live entirely in the .cpp.
